# Zeak

ERP Application built with:

- [Remix](https://remix.run)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- [Postgres](https://postgresql.org/)
- [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io)

## Code Organization

### `app/components`

Reusable react components that are specific to this project (and remix). Shared components should live in `packages/react` if they don't rely on some application-specific library. For example, the `Table` relies on some remix internals, so it lives in `app/components`, but the `Date` component is framework agnostic, so it lives in `packages/react`.

### `app/jobs`

Where background tasks are defined.

### `app/modules`

Where services, ui and form validators are defined for each module.

### `app/routes`

File-based route definitions using `remix`. This is where the services and interfaces meet. Each route is loaded in parallel for performance, so each route is responsible for defining it's own authorization and data needs. Each route has three parts (none are required):

1. `export async function loader`: The data that the route returns, which can be accessed via `GET` or `useLoaderData` in the component (3)
2. `export async function action`: The actions (`POST` or `DELETE`) for the route, which can be accessed via http methods or through the `ValidatedForm` component.
3. `export default function`: The nested react component for the route. This renders inside the `<Outlet/>` component of the parent route.
